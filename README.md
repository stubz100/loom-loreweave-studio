# Loreweave Studio (`loom`)

A non-linear storyboard / story-generation desktop app. Tauri (Rust shell) +
React/TypeScript UI + a Python FastAPI orchestrator that wraps the
`run_pipeline.py` generation CLIs behind a single VRAM-aware job queue.

> **Status: Phase 0 (foundation) — ✅ COMPLETE & ACCEPTED (M0–M8, 7/7 acceptance green).**
> App shell + orchestrator handshake (M0), one real generation (M1), an N-image batch
> streaming into a selectable grid (M2), the hardened adapter contract — token-gated
> `/generate`, `capabilities()`, coarse progress, **cancel = worker-tree kill**,
> manifest-status-as-truth (M3) — a **durable, resume-paused `queue.json`** with VRAM
> admission + OOM retry (M4), **durable bundle I/O + `loom init` project workspaces**
> (stable IDs, `schema_version`, atomic writes, JSON Schemas, lineage edge, footprint
> estimator; the queue + outputs + per-job logs live in a real `<project>/`, M5),
> a **continuously-polled disk guard** (two measures × two thresholds; hard-stop blocks
> new jobs, M6), a **phase-scoped launch gate** (3-state component manifest; refuse to
> start on a missing P0 code component; missing P0 weight → explicit HF fetch, M7), and
> the **§1 seven-step acceptance test green on real hardware** (M8).
>
> **Phase 1 (MVP creative layer) — underway.** **M1–M2 done:** L2 Asset Studio scaffold (StoryBible
> style fragment auto-applied R104 (appended after the user/character prompt since 2026-06-10);
> AssetProfile + `v1_base`; library rail), **Stage-A casting** —
> `casting[]` + hero-star ★ persisted into `version.json` (self-contained `casting/` copies), and the
> **`multi` adapter onboarded** (one cast → a pool of N candidates across flux2+sd35+zimage; per-
> candidate tiles, output-keyed star; real-GPU verified). **M2 review hardening:** the `multi`
stack is now **vendored** (`pipelines/multistack/`, clone-runnable) and a cast **pre-flights its
selected preset's gated weights** (412 + fetch, not a mid-run crash). **M3 — Stage B+C, the MVP
done-line — implemented** (real-GPU acceptance pending): the **frozen coverage-cell P1→P2 contract**
(`coverage.py`), the **coverage-matrix dataset recipe** (`recipe.py`, 5 presets), `_img2img`/inpaint
on **zimage + sd35**, the **full model catalog** (every flux2/sd35/zimage variant + every tunable, incl.
ungated `sd3.5-medium`; `GET /models` + a catalog-validated `params` channel), **Stage-B expansion**
(`POST /assets/{id}/stage-b` → **one batch img2img job**: the worker loads the model once and
loops every recipe cell via `--jobs-file`; per-output `coverage_cell` in `result.output_meta`), and
**Stage-C curation → Save AssetProfile** (keep/cull → `ref_set`, Saved-not-Finalized) with the A·B·C
bootstrap-strip UI. **M3 ACCEPTED 2026-06-11** (user GPU sign-off). **M3.5** — BiRefNet matting →
hero **bg mask** + `realize="mixed"` Stage-B expansion (inpaint cells repaint the background around
the held subject — the background-diversity axis). **M4** — face **anchor** (`POST
/assets/{id}/anchor`) + the **identity-lock pass** (inswapper swap to the anchor, chained after
Stage-B, default-on once the anchor is verified; clean/polish/identity run as **chained
post-passes** on any pipeline). **P1-12** — curation throughput (persistent reject list, bulk
keep/reject, keyboard k/x/space, coverage filters). **M5** — profile versioning (copy-on-create
from any parent incl. files+anchor, finalize = R60 lock on every mutator, version selector +
parent-picker modal, read-only finalized UI). **M6/M6.1** — **face-restore pass** (GFPGAN 1.4
ONNX — chain order clean → polish → identity → restore) + **face-portrait anchor derivation**
(`POST /assets/{id}/anchor/derive`: restored aligned 512² crop of the largest face → anchor it);
masking/upscale deferred "as needed". **M7** — video-sketch harvest (`POST
/assets/{id}/stage-b/sketch`: a cell-targeted `ltxv` i2v motion sketch from the hero ★ → a
chained `frame_harvest` pass extracts stills carrying that coverage cell → curate like recipe
cells; pose/angle coverage img2img can't reach, without 3D). **M8** — full L1 World (`/bible`:
world prose, the style **global negative** auto-applied to every generation surface, and the
**story spine** whose characters seed stub AssetProfiles + manual re-sync, R55). **M9** —
**export/import profiles** (`GET /assets/{id}/export` → a portable .zip of the profile + ALL
its versions + files; `POST /assets/import` → ALWAYS a new profile with fresh ids,
`derived_from` remapped, rename-on-collision, never a merge, R66/R67 — both token-gated,
size/zip-bomb guarded). **M10** — **MVP/P1 acceptance**: the §1 done-line
(style → cast → hero → expand → curate → save → **reopen**) is locked as an executable no-GPU
test (`orchestrator/tests/test_acceptance.py`) and the new adapters' contract gaps are recorded
(journal M10). 🟡 **Awaiting the user's GPU rig sign-off** (done-line + chained passes + mixed +
identity + restore + video + curation + export/import round-trip) to declare P1 ACCEPTED.
**P1-11 (Flux2 multi-ref) — ✅ GO + WIRED**: the §11 spike landed, so Stage-B gained a third
expansion family — `pipeline=flux2`, the **`ref` mode**: the hero ★ rides as an in-context
reference (FLUX.2 `encode_image_refs` + `denoise(img_cond_seq=…)`), so each coverage cell gets
**identity-preserving** pose/angle/scene variation that img2img structurally can't (a front
portrait can't be rotated to a profile). One `--jobs-file` batch job (two-phase offload, module-
invoked); GPU batch smoke verified.

A **project** is a folder on the work disk (`<work disk>/<name>/`, default `F:\_tmp`, R72):

```

```

**Pipeline code is vendored into this repo per-phase** (R162): the P0 worker
(`zimage`) and the P1/M2 **`multi` casting stack** (`pipelines/multistack/` — `multi`
plus its `flux2`/`sd35`/`zimage` sub-pipelines and the `flux2` model lib) live in
`pipelines/` so a clone can generate on its own. `multi` is module-invoked and its
`stage_runner` self-locates the sub-pipelines + lib by paths relative to its own file,
so the vendored copy **mirrors the monorepo's `src/pipeline/` + `flux2/src/` layout
exactly** — no edits to the pipeline code, so it can't drift in logic from the source.
The orchestrator resolves each pipeline **in-repo first**, falling back to the parent
monorepo's `src/pipeline/` during dev. Model **weights are never vendored** (R160) —
they stay external (HF / the parent monorepo's `src/village_ai/models/`) and are
fetched on demand.

## Dev quickstart

The orchestrator runs in the parent monorepo's shared `.venv` (R103); install its
deps once: `pip install -r orchestrator/requirements.txt`.

**1. Orchestrator** (from this repo root):

```powershell
$env:LOOM_VENV_PYTHON = "..\..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe"
..\..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m orchestrator.main
# prints: LOOM_ORCH_READY url=http://127.0.0.1:8765 token=…
# GET /health -> {"status":"ok",...} ; POST /generate {"prompt":"…","count":3}
```

**2. UI only** (from `app/`): `npm install` then `npm run dev` → http://localhost:1420.

**3. Full desktop app** (from `app/`): `npm run tauri dev` — boots the window, spawns
the orchestrator as a sidecar, and kills it on exit. (Requires the Rust toolchain.)

## Known gaps (P0, by milestone)

- Job queue is **durable + resume-paused** (M4, `queue.json`); cancel works (M3); VRAM
  admission is enforced. Since **M5** the queue + outputs + per-job logs live in a real
  per-project `<project>/` workspace; `/generate` needs an **open project** (the last one
  re-opens on launch). **Opening** a project uses a **registry picker** ("Open ▾" — a list of
  recent projects from `.loom_state`, machine-local, not in git); a project can be **closed**
  ("Close" — the app runs project-less and a relaunch won't auto-reopen it; nothing is deleted,
  reopening resumes the queue paused). **File-watch** (read-side change
  events) isn't wired yet, and **creating** a project is still prompt-based (native folder picker +
  format/cap wizard come later — deferred with the user's blessing 2026-06-10).
- The **disk guard** (M6) polls project-cap headroom + work-disk free continuously; a
  **hard-stop (<2%) returns 507** on `/generate` and holds queued jobs (running jobs
  finish). Project size is an `os.walk` sum each poll — fine for P0; an incremental
  accountant is a later refinement once PNG-sequence masters make projects large.
- A finished generation can be **deleted safely** from the grid (🗑 on a tile): the orchestrator
  atomically removes the output dir + sidecar manifest, the per-job log, the queue entry, and the
  lineage edge (`DELETE /jobs/{id}`) — no orphaned files (vs hand-deleting). The **persistent
  browse-past-generations grid** (showing prior `done` images on reopen) is the **P1 casting grid**;
  the P0 grid is per-session (data isn't lost — it's in the lineage index + manifests).
- The **launch gate** (M7) hard-requires the P0-essential code components at startup
  (`zimage`, queue, workspace I/O) and **refuses to start** with a clear error if one is
  missing. A missing P0 **weight** doesn't block startup — it's reported (`/components`,
  `/health.weights_ok`) so the UI can **fetch on demand** (`POST /components/fetch`), and
  `/generate` returns **412** until it's present. Presence-only (R97); **sha256 verify on
  fetch is TODO** until the companion HF repo publishes hashes.
- The **`multi` casting weights** (flux2 + sd35, mostly HF-**gated**) are **preset-scoped, not
  phase-scoped** (`models.json` → `multi_presets`): a `multi` cast pre-flights just the
  **selected** ideation preset (`fast`|`refined`) at `/generate` and returns **412** listing
  the exact missing repos (so it fails fast, not mid-GPU-run); fetch via
  `POST /components/fetch?multi_preset=…`. Kept out of the launch gate on purpose — folding
  all presets' gated checkpoints into startup would over-gate a 16 GB rig. Gated repos still
  need a one-time license acceptance on huggingface.co + an `HF_TOKEN`. The preset→weights
  table mirrors `pipeline/multi`'s `IDEATION_PRESETS` (incl. the per-variant text encoder).
- On app exit the Tauri shell does a **graceful shutdown handshake** (P0-15): it calls
  `POST /shutdown` so the orchestrator re-queues the in-flight job + marks a clean stop
  (relaunch resumes it **queued/paused**, not failed — R159), then hard-kills as a
  fallback so the port is never left held (the worker is also Job-Object-reaped — no
  orphaned GPU). A genuine *crash* (no handshake) still correctly lands the in-flight job
  as `failed` for the user to inspect.
- **img2img / inpaint** are wired in P1/M3 (Stage-B expansion) on **zimage** + **sd35** —
  `/generate` takes `mode` + `init_image`/`mask_image` (out/-relative, traversal-guarded) +
  `strength`. The mode is accepted only if the adapter wires it (else 400); img2img needs an
  init image, inpaint needs init + mask (else 422). (P0 was t2i-only.)
- The on-demand HF **fetch** flow is built (M7: `POST /components/fetch` + the UI's
  [Fetch now]); what's still pending is **publishing** the artifacts — `models.json`'s
  companion-repo URL + sha256s are **placeholders** (R160), so `file`-type fetches and
  **checksum verification** can't be exercised until that repo exists. (`hf_diffusers`
  weights like `zimage` already fetch via diffusers/the hub cache.)
- App icon is **placeholder art**.

## Configuration

A central **`.env`** at the repo root is the master config, read by both the
orchestrator (`config.py`) and the Vite UI (`envDir: ".."`). **`.env` is committed
(non-secret only).** Secrets — the orchestrator **token** — go in a gitignored
**`.env.local`** (`LOOM_ORCH_TOKEN` + `VITE_LOOM_ORCH_TOKEN`); copy the template at the
bottom of `.env`. In the packaged Tauri app the token is generated at runtime and
injected into the webview, so no `.env.local` is needed there. Precedence: real env var
> `.env.local` > `.env` > built-in default.

**Security:** `POST /generate` requires the `X-Loom-Token` header (the no-surprise-GPU
gate, R141–143); CORS is restricted to the dev + Tauri origins. `npm run dev` sends the
token from `.env.local`.
